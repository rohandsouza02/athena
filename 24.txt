Good morning team! Alex, let's start with you again.
Morning! Yesterday went well - got the wireframes done and set up all the basic React components for the dashboard. Today I'm going to work on the actual layout implementation and make sure everything's responsive. Should be able to integrate with our design system components.
How's the component structure looking?
Pretty clean actually. I'm using the new component library we built last month, so it's going smoothly.
Excellent. Jordan, your updates?
Good progress yesterday. Database schema is all set up and I got the user registration endpoint mostly done. Today I want to finish that up and start on the login functionality. Need to add proper validation and error handling too.
Jordan, when you're ready, can you drop the API specs in Slack? I want to make sure my test cases align.
Sure, I'll send them over after this meeting.
Great collaboration. Sam?
Thanks! So yesterday I finished up most of the test case documentation and started setting up the automated testing framework for the API endpoints. Today I want to get that framework fully configured so we can start running tests as soon as Jordan's endpoints are ready.
Actually, registration endpoint should be testable by end of day today.
Perfect! I'll be ready.
Taylor, how are things on your end?
Docker containers are all configured now. Yesterday was mostly about getting the basic CI/CD structure in place. Today I'm working on adding the automated testing into the pipeline and getting all the environment variables configured properly.
Any blockers for anyone?
Still waiting on that requirements document, but I'm proceeding with what we have.
I need access to the production AWS account. I put in the request but it hasn't been approved yet.
I'll escalate that for you today. Anything else? Alright, see you all tomorrow.
