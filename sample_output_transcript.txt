[01:39] Rashi Shrishrimal: I won't say. Should I start? Huh. So good morning, team. Let's start our daily stand-up by sharing what you completed since yesterday, any blockers and your plans for today. Let's start with Parikshit. Yesterday, I completed updating the sitemap with new Apple smartphone retailers. Today I am working on the landing page metadata. I made partial progress but ran into some inconsistencies with the copy that I will clarify with the growth team. No blockers as such. Okay, cool. What about you Mayank? Okay cool. I'm working on the landing page front-end development. I've made good progress, but I'm waiting on the product team to provide the final design assets which is blocking further work. I will need your help to escalate this further. Meanwhile, I plan to take up other pending to-do issues. I will talk to the product team. Please take up the bug on the scraping of Apple products, which came up yesterday today. What about you, Saksham? I began work on the admin page. I have no blockers and plan What? to continue with the page layout and initial functionality today. Thanks for the updates. Let's close the meeting
