Morning everyone! Alex, you're up first.
Hey! Yesterday was productive - got the entire dashboard layout done and the responsive design is working great. Today I want to add the data visualization components and start connecting to the mock API for now. Also planning to work on the user profile section.
Actually Alex, my endpoints might be ready sooner than expected. Let me check where I'm at after this standup.
Oh that would be awesome! I'd much rather connect to real data.
Love the collaboration. Jordan, your updates?
Yeah, so yesterday I completed both the registration and login APIs, including all the validation logic. Today I'm working on user profile management endpoints and the password reset functionality. If all goes well, I should be able to deploy to staging this afternoon.
That's perfect timing!
Sam, how did testing go?
Good! I got the testing framework fully set up yesterday and I was able to run some initial tests on Jordan's registration endpoint. Found a couple minor issues - nothing major, just some edge cases with validation.
Yeah, Sam messaged me about those. Easy fixes, I can get those done this morning.
Thanks! Today I want to run the full test suite once you deploy, and then I'll start preparing tests for Alex's frontend integration.
Excellent. Taylor?
Still waiting on that production access, which is getting frustrating. But I've been productive - got the automated testing integrated into the pipeline yesterday and environment variables are all configured. Today I'm optimizing our Docker images to reduce build times and setting up monitoring.
I escalated your access request yesterday. Let me ping our security team right after this meeting.
Thanks, I appreciate it.
Hey, once Taylor gets production access, how quickly can we do a production deploy?
We'll need to do a proper release plan, but shouldn't be more than a day or two after everything's ready.
Any other blockers? Just the AWS access?
That's the main one, yeah.
Alright, I'll get that sorted today. See everyone tomorrow!
